**3D LiDAR Obstacle Detection using RANSAC, PCA, and KD-Tree Cluster**

**Introduction:**

This project aims to implement a robust 3D LiDAR object detection system using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) and KD Tree algorithms, leveraging the Open3D library. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors provide dense point cloud data, which can be utilized for various applications, including object detection in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and environmental monitoring. This project focuses on detecting objects within the point cloud data acquired from LiDAR sensors mounted on vehicles or drones.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- Open3D
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

**Installation:**

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install Open3D using pip:

   ```
   pip install open3d
   ```

3. Install NumPy:

   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

4. Optionally, install Matplotlib for visualization:

   ```
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd 3d-lidar-object-detection
   ```

3. Run the main Python script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

**Project Structure:**

- **main.py**: Entry point of the application. Contains the main logic for processing LiDAR data and detecting objects.
  
- **ransac.py**: Implementation of the RANSAC algorithm for plane fitting in point clouds.
  
- **kd_tree.py**: Implementation of KD Tree data structure for efficient nearest neighbor search.
  
- **utils.py**: Utility functions for data loading, visualization, and other common tasks.
  
- **data/**: Directory containing sample 3D LiDAR point cloud data for testing purposes.
  
- **results/**: Directory where the results of object detection (e.g., bounding boxes) are stored.

**Algorithm Overview:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the 3D LiDAR point cloud data.
  
2. **Plane Segmentation**: Use RANSAC to segment ground plane from the point cloud data.
  
3. **Object Detection**:
   - Construct KD Tree for efficient nearest neighbor search.
   - Segment objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) by clustering points around the detected ground plane.
  
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the detected objects and ground plane (optional).
